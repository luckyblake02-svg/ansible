The vault is stored at <path>/vault/secrets.yaml. It is encrypted so you can only view it with the vault password. Trying to cat the file will only show the encryption.
 
Instead, use
ansible-vault view <vault>.yaml and enter the password.
Passwords in the vault are store in the format of su_password: "password".
To create a new vault, dig down into the .new directory and run ./newVault.sh.
To view the current vault password, use ./vaultPass.sh.
To view the current sudo user password, use ./userPass.sh.
